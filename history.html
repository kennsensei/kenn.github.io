				<h1>BRIEF HISTORY OF BALILIHAN</h1>
				<p>The towns of Bohol either got their names from plants or from mis-interpreted<br> words at the onset
				of the Spanish occupation of the island. For Balilihan,<br> its name was derived from a grass called balili
				which grew <br>in abundance in the locality. “Balilihan” means a place where<br> plenty of “balili” grows.</p>
				<h2>Present</h2>
				<p>The Municipality of Balilihan has set its foundation day on September 29, 1828; <br>supposedly the day when the town
				was separated from its mother town, Baclayon.<br> The date is questionable though, for per historical records,<br> its founding
				date was officially recorded on another date. <br>How and why this is so is yet to be clarified.</p>
				<p> Succeeding historical events will be posted here according to dates<br> to illustrate comprehensively the events
				that transpired.<br> What has been observed, and has been done throughout the years, <br>was that the town of Balilihan 
				celebrates with much fanfare their foundation <br>day on September 29, 1828. Week-long activities are scheduled aside from 
				the thanksgiving Mass <br>on the foundation day itself with the ever present<br> street dancing competition</p>
				
				<h3>How the Municipality of Balilihan was Established</h3>
				<p>	Balilihan was an old settlement, a barrio under the municipality of Baclayon with the families Orig, Dangoy,
				Racho, Maniwang, Lacea and Pongase as the first inhabitants. The population grew when more people from other towns
				came to settle in the area.With the significant growth in population,the inhabitants sought to make their
				place be a “visita” or mission field.</p>
				<p>	On February 5, 1828, prior to the capture of the Dagohoy insurgents, Captain Manuel Sanz’
				request to establish resettlement areas in Boholin places called Balilihan, Batuanan, Catigbian, Vilar, Candijay and
				Cabulao was approved by the Governor General Mariano Ricafort.</p>
				<p>In April 1828, Governor-general Ricafort sent the last drive against the rebels under Captain Manuel Sanz, 
				a veteran Spanish soldier. Without Dagohoy’s able leadership, the rebels fought and made their last stand in 
				the mountains of Boasa under the command of brothers, Handog and Auag. They fought in vain.
				</p>
				<p>	A garrison was established by the Spanish authorities at Datag, one of the barrios of Balilihan,to discourage
				and stamp out further uprisings of the natives.Per records of the town, Balilihan was separated from Baclayon on 
				September 29, 1828 and the Spanish government, represented by Friar Tomas, formally established a settlement
				or “pueblo” in the Sitio “Bay sa Iring”. The Sitio was named so for the network of caves from where cats go and hide.
				The Sitio was about two kilometers from the Spanish garrison. Serafin Pongase was appointed as the first captain,
				but his administration was short-lived because he met his death in the hands of Manuel Danila with whom he had an altercation.
				</p>
				<p>	The next historical data was the official report of Captain Sanz stating that the town of Balilihan was officially settled
				on April 1829 with the assignment of its corresponding Parish Priest. The following month, on May 20, 1829, the people were 
				convened to choose their Patron Saint.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the followers of Dagohoy were finally disbanded in August 31, 1829, they were pardoned and allowed to live in peace. 
				On this date, the Spanish conqueror, Captain Manuel Sanz, reported that Balilihan has now a total population of 2,100 people 
				under the temporary administration of Father Manuel Plaza de San Benito.
				</p>
				<p>
					On September 2, 1829, now Major Sanz requested that Balilihan and other settlement areas be made into new towns in the civil
					jurisdiction only. On December 9, 1831, the new Governor General Pascual Enrile officially approved the recommendation of 
					Major Manuel Sanz.
